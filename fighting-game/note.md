# Fighting Game

## Player and Enemey chars

1. To create characters make sure we are within `index.js`

2. Use OOP to create characters to make sure interactions between happens properly.

## Movement

1. Use event listeners to move the player and enemy
2. To move the player use `keydown` and `keyup` events to set the `velocity` of the player
3. To precisely move the player while holding two keys we've set `const keys` to hold the keys pressed
